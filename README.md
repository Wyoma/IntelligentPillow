# IntelligentPillow

Welcome to the Intelligent Pillow's algorithm!

IntelligentPillow.py contains all the code used to create spectrograms from sound files, as well as to run the machine learning model.

However, I have not included the sound files and spectrograms, and instead have uploaded dataset.csv file pre-populated with data from my set of sound files.

Thank you!
